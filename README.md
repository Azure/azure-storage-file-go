# Azure Storage File SDK for Go
[![GoDoc Widget]][GoDoc] [![Build Status][Travis Widget]][Travis]

The Microsoft Azure Storage SDK for Go allows you to build applications that takes advantage of Azure's scalable cloud storage. 

This repository contains the open source File SDK for Go.

## Features
* File Storage
	* Create/List/Delete Shares
	* Create/List/Delete Directories
	* Create/Read/List/Update/Delete Files

## Getting Started
* If you don't already have it, install [the Go distribution](https://golang.org/dl/)
* Get the SDK, with any method you prefer:
    * Go Get: ```go get github.com/Azure/azure-storage-file-go/azfile```
    * Dep: add ```github.com/Azure/azure-storage-file-go``` to Gopkg.toml:
        ```
        [[constraint]]
          version = "0.4.0"
          name = "github.com/Azure/azure-storage-file-go"
        ```
    * Module: simply import the SDK and Go will download it for you
* Use the SDK:
```import "github.com/Azure/azure-storage-file-go/azfile"```

## Version Table
* If you are looking to use a specific version of the Storage Service, please refer to the following table: 

| Service Version | Corresponding SDK Version | Import Path                                              |
|-----------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 2017-07-29      | 0.3.0                     | github.com/Azure/azure-storage-file-go/2017-07-29/azfile |
| 2018-03-28      | 0.4.0+                    | github.com/Azure/azure-storage-file-go/azfile            |

Note: the directory structure of the SDK has changed dramatically since 0.4.0. The different Service Versions are no longer sub-directories;
the latest `azfile` is directly under the root directory. In the future, each new Service Version will be introduced with a new major semantic version.
	

## SDK Architecture

* The Azure Storage SDK for Go provides low-level and high-level APIs.
	* ServiceURL, ShareURL, DirectoryURL and FileURL objects provide the low-level API functionality and map one-to-one to the [Azure Storage File REST APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/file-service-rest-api)
	* The high-level APIs provide convenience abstractions such as uploading a large stream to an Azure file (using multiple PutRange requests in parallel) or downloading a large Azure file to local (using multiple Get requests in parallel).
